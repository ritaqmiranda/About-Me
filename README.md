    At times this could be challenging, as our tenure would progress and the more the learning material increased, as well as balancing a healthy work-life balance, juggling personal commitments.
    To ensure I would meet the deadlines consistently and continuously, I ensured to:
         1. Prioritise: I assessed the urgency and importance of each task to determine which ones needed to be completed first, as well as identified larger knowledge-gaps that would require more attention.
         2. Time Management: I created a detailed schedule outlining specific time slots for studying, completing assignments, and taking breaks. By allocating dedicated time for each task, I ensured that I made progress consistently and effectively.
         3. Efficient Studying: I adopted efficient study techniques such as active recall, spaced repetition, and summarization to maximize my learning in a limited amount of time. Instead of passively reading through the material, I engaged in active learning strategies that helped me grasp key concepts more effectively.
         4. Seeking Support: I reached out to classmates and professors for clarification on concepts that I found challenging. Collaborating with peers not only helped me gain different perspectives but also facilitated a more efficient learning process.
